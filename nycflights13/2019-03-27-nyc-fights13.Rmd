## About the dataset

In this analysis, we explore the dplyr functions used to ask interesting questions of a more complex dataset Weâ€™ll use a dataset of flights that departed from New York city airports (including Newark, John F. Kennedy, and Laguardia airports) in 2013. This dataset is also featured online in the Introduction to dplyr vignette, and is drawn from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics database.

This dataset will use over 300,000 observations to ask the following questions:

* Which airline has the highest number of delayed departures?
* On average, to which airport do flights arrive most early?
* In which month do flights tend to have the longest delays?

### get to know the dataframe

```{r}
## check the number of rows/columns
dim(flights)
## inspect the column names
colnames(flights) 
```

### Identify the airline (`carrier`) that has the highest number of delayed flights

```{r}
## start with the flights
has_most_delays <- flights %>%
  ## group by airline (carrier)
  group_by(carrier) %>%                    
  ## find only the delays
  filter(dep_delay > 0) %>%               
  ## count the observations
  summarize(num_delay = n()) %>%           
  ## find most delayed
  filter(num_delay == max(num_delay)) %>%  
  ## select the airline
  select(carrier)                          
```

### Get name of the most delayed carrier

```{r}
## start with the previous answer
most_delayed_name <- has_most_delays %>%   
  ## join on airline ID
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%  
  ## select the airline name
  select(name)                             
```

```{r}
## access the value from the tibble
print(most_delayed_name$name)
```

### Calculate the average arrival delay (`arr_delay`) for each destination (`dest`)

```{r}
most_early <- flights %>%
  ## group by destination
  group_by(dest) %>%                     
  ## compute mean delay
  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay))     
```

### # Compute the average delay by destination airport, omitting NA results

```{r}
most_early <- flights %>%
  ## group by destination
  group_by(dest) %>%                                 
  ## compute mean delay
  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))   
```

### Identify the destination where flights, on average, arrive most early

```{r}
most_early <- flights %>%
  ## group by destination
  group_by(dest) %>%                                      
  ## compute mean delay, ignore NA
  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%    
  ## filter for the *least* delayed
  filter(delay == min(delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%           
  ## select the destination (and delay to store it)
  select(dest, delay) %>%                                 
  ## join on `airports`dataframe
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>%         
  ## select output variables of interest
  select(dest, name, delay)                               
```

```{r}
print(most_early)
```

### Identify the month in which flights tend to have the longest delays

```{r}
flights %>%
  ## group by selected feature
  group_by(month) %>%                                      
  ## summarize value of interest
  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%     
  ## filter for the record of interest
  filter(delay == max(delay)) %>%                          
  ## select the column that answers the question
  select(month) %>%                                        
  ## print the tibble out directly
  print()                                                  
```

### Compute delay by month, adding month names for visual display, note 'month.name' is a variable build into R

```{r}
delay_by_month <- flights %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  select(delay) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name)
```

### # Create a plot using the ggplot2 package

```{r}
ggplot(data = delay_by_month) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = delay, y = month), 
    color = "blue",
    alpha = .4, 
    size = 3
    ) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0, size = .25) +
  xlim(c(-20, 20)) +
  scale_y_discrete(limits = rev(month.name)) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(title = "Average Delay by Month", y = "", x = "Delay (minutes)")
```
